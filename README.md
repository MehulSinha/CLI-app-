# CLI-app-
CLI app using golang 

A small Ping CLI application for MacOS or Linux. The CLI app should accept a hostname or an IP address as its argument, then send ICMP "echo requests" in a loop to the target while receiving "echo reply" messages. It should report loss and RTT times for each sent message.
